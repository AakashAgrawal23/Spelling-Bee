THE PYTHON CODE SOLVES THE SPELLING BEE PUZZLE!

TAKES IN THE CENTRE WORD AND SURROUNDING 6 WORDS!

HAVE NOT BRUSHED IT, THE USER INPUT WORKS BUT THE LAST CONDITION TO CHECK CENTRE LETTER IN WORD IS STATIC... IT SHOULD NOT BE DIFFICULT AT ALL TO CONVERT IT TO DYNAMIC

THE ORIGINAL WORD FILE IS SOURCED FROM http://www.gwicks.net/dictionaries.htm

NOT TOO SURE ABOUT THE LEGALITY OF THE SOURCE SO USE WITH CAUTION

I HAVE UPLOADED THE .TXT FILE

HAVE FUN!
